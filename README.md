This is a basic api that aggregates results from [Frankfurter api](https://api.frankfurter.app/) and
[Economia api](https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br/json/daily/) to produce simple metrics
on exchange rates between two currencies during given time perion.

## Running

or by filling in provided static html form.
To run the server on port 8080 type
